# Voice Biller - The new way of billing
üîä A billing mobile app that helps you bill items based on voice commands

## ü§îAbout The Project
As we all have seen a lot of malls, supermarkets have tools such as barcode scanner to bill the items. These might or might not be affordable but are not feasible for small scale businesses or wholesale shops. Keeping that in mind we developed this app where all the shopkeeper has to do is just install this app and start billing.
## üí°Features
##### The features offered by this app are:
1. Allows you to bill items based on your voice commands                                                                                                             
2. Allows you to view the previous bills billed                                                                                                                     
3. Allows you to share the bills directly to the customer by any means of your choice                                                                               
4. Allows you to add items to the database from your phone                                                                                                           
5. Easy and convenient login through Google or Facebook                                                                                                             
## üèÉHow to get it up and running
You can download the app and use it out of the box by clicking this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8zaj7krszxbww1i/voicebillerapp-6440b6a9ca2b47299aeaf9b07490ec97-signed.apk?dl=0). If you want to implement stuff that you think that could have been added follow these steps:
1. First up you will need nodeJS and expo go mobile app to render the app without building it. Find out more about it [here](https://expo.dev/).
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/manojsagar066/voice_billing.git`
3. Navigate to the voice_billing directory 
4. If you donot have expo cli type:`npm i -g expo-cli`                                                                                                                or if yarn is what you use as your package manager type: `yarn global add expo-cli` 
5. To install the additional dependencies of the project type                                                                                                               `npm install` or `yarn add `
6. Once all the installation process is out of the way type the following to get the metro bundler up and running.                                                           `expo start`
7. Now you can choose on what platform you want the app, I would reccomend you to run it on android.
8. After you select the platform wait for the javascript bundle to build. Once that is done voil√† the app is up and running. Have fun by fidling with it, implementing your own stuff.
